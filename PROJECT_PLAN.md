# Project Plan: End-to-End Question-Answering System for ArXiv Papers

### 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the plan for developing an end-to-end system that allows users to ask natural language questions about scientific research papers from ArXiv. The system will focus on a specific Machine Learning domain, retrieve relevant information from a curated set of papers, and generate accurate, context-aware answers.

**Core Objectives:**
- **Data Ingestion:** Automatically fetch, parse, and process research papers from ArXiv.
- **Information Retrieval:** Use a vector database to efficiently store and retrieve text chunks relevant to a user's query.
- **Answer Generation:** Leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize an answer from the retrieved context.
- **User Interface:** Provide a simple, interactive web interface for users to ask questions.
- **Evaluation:** Establish a framework to measure the performance and accuracy of the system.

### 2. System Architecture (RAG Pipeline)

The system will be built using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture. This approach enhances the LLM's knowledge by grounding its responses in specific, retrieved documents, reducing hallucinations and providing more accurate, up-to-date answers.

### 3. Core Components & Implementation

#### a. Data Ingestion and Processing
- **Source:** [ArXiv API](https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/index.html). We will use the `arxiv` Python library to search for and download papers.
- **Parsing:** PDFs will be parsed using the `pypdf` library to extract raw text content.
- **Text Chunking:** The extracted text will be split into smaller, overlapping chunks (e.g., 1000 characters with a 200-character overlap).

#### b. Vector Database
- **Choice:** **ChromaDB**. It's open-source, easy to set up locally, and integrates well with Python.
- **Embedding Model:** We will use `sentence-transformers` (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).

#### c. LLM and Answer Generation
- **Model:** **Llama 2** (or a similar open-source model like Mistral).
- **Hosting:** Run the model locally using **Ollama** for simplicity and cost-effectiveness.
- **Prompt Engineering:** A carefully crafted prompt will combine the user's question with the retrieved context to guide the LLM's response.

#### d. Front-End
- **Framework:** **Streamlit**. It allows for the rapid development of interactive web UIs directly in Python.

### 4. Evaluation Strategy

Measuring the system's accuracy is critical. We can evaluate it at two key stages: retrieval and generation.

#### a. Retrieval Evaluation
- **Metric:** **Hit Rate**.
- **Process:** Create a small evaluation set of question-answer pairs. For each question, see if the correct text chunk is present in the top-k retrieved results.

#### b. Generation Evaluation
- **Metrics:** **Faithfulness** (is the answer supported by the source?) and **Relevance** (does it answer the question?).
- **Process:** Use the same evaluation set and have a human reviewer score the generated answers against the source context.

**Interpreting "92% Accuracy":**
A defensible claim would be: "The retrieval system achieved a 92% hit rate on our evaluation set, ensuring the LLM receives the correct context for generating its answer in the vast majority of cases."
